#Electronic Health Record Smart Contract

This EHR smart contract is here to demonstrate a use case for solidity smart contract.

The account deploying the contract is automatically assigned as the administrator (admin).

The admin is the only account that can grant doctor approval.

The patient can only create an account for themselves and view their own health records

Approved doctors can only update and view patient history

NOTE: only manual testing has occured. Automated testing is still being developed.
